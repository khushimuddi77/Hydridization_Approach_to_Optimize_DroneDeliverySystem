Project Overview:
The project presents an optimization approach for improving drone delivery scheduling by minimizing the expected loss of demand, while considering potential drone failures. It explores integration of machine learning and bio-inspired optimization algorithms to address this complex problem .It provides a comprehensive comparison of the performance of hybridization of K-Mean Clustering algorithm and Genetic algorithm with hybridization of Hierarchial Agglomerative Clustering algorithm and Ant Colony Optimization algorithm, offering valuable insights into efficient and reliable drone delivery operations.

Dataset contains the distance and payload of 500 customers.
